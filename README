Bunshin
~~~~~~~

Bunshin is a framework to generate RFC 822 style message from
fragments of Web pages such that they can be subscribed in your
favorite mail or news readers.  Bunshin itself is just a Perl module
to implement the feature; actual processes - retrieval of Web pages,
extraction of fragments, and injection to mail or news servers should
be done by an application using the Bunsin module.

* Dependency

Bunshin requires Perl and manakai <https://github.com/wakaba/manakai>.

* Availability

Bunshin is available in the Git repository
<http://suika.fam.cx/gate/git/wi/messages/bunshin.git/tree>.
